{"_id":"note:5YlSJv0a6","title":"React JS - Part 2","content":"- List and key\n```\n\t- React requires a locally unique key to be used for rendering arrays, to be able to detect when element was changed, added or deleted.\n\t- If that object has an Id, and might change values during lifetime - use Id. In this case id is the only way to let React know, that this \"new\" object is that \"old\" object.\n\t- If that object doesn't has an Id, or it is constant - don't use Id. You have an item. Item itself IS THE KEY. But you cant use \"object\" as a key, as long key should be a string. But you can convert it to string. An unique string\n    - Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings\n```","tags":[],"folderPathname":"/","data":{},"createdAt":"2020-11-10T09:45:02.713Z","updatedAt":"2020-11-10T09:48:04.381Z","trashed":false,"_rev":"l-QCHF6cu"}
